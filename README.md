# Cholesterol-Level-Analyzer-GUI-using-Gradio-Python-Coding-Joy


Based on the readings of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,HDL cholesterol and triglycerides of a patientâ€™s blood sample taken in mg/dL obtained from Cholesterol Test
/ Lipid Profile,the task at hand is to interpret these readings and check whether the patient has an ideal level of cholesterol or not .

This task can be accomplished using one of Python's potent library, Gradio .

Gradio is a library that is used for creating UI components with minimal lines of code.

In my blog post on Coding Joy, I have discussed at length about the constraints , the variables used and the algorithm to solve this problem.
